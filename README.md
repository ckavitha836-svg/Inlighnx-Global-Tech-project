Final project Submmision 
I have taken the sales financial data to create the dashboards.
This project presents an interactive Sales Financial Dashboard created using Power BI to analyze overall business performance.
The dashboard highlights key KPIs such as Total Sales (118.73M), Total Profit (16.89M), Total Quantity (1.13M), COGS (101.83M), and Total Products (700).
It provides a product-wise analysis to identify top-performing and low-performing products based on sales and profit.
A segment-wise sales distribution helps understand customer contribution across different market segments.
The country-wise sales visualization enables geographical performance comparison.
Monthly and yearly trends are analyzed to track sales and profit growth over time.
Interactive slicers allow users to filter data by year, month, product, and country for deeper insights.
The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify profitability drivers and cost patterns.
This project demonstrates strong skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and data visualization.
Overall, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by converting raw sales data into meaningful insights.
